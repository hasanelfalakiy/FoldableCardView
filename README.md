## FoldableCardView
An Android library that lets you create in a simple, fast and hassle-free way a CardView in which you can insert your custom layout and just expand and collapse without even writing a single Java/Kotlin line of code.

This code is taken from [AleSpero](https://github.com/AleSpero/ExpandableCardView.git), then I changed and rewrote it using ViewBinding and Material Design 3.

### New version (with Material Design 3)
<div align="center">

<img width="125" height="250" src="./img/new1.jpg" alt="Screenshot_01" title="Screenshot_01">
<img width="125" height="250" src="./img/new2.jpg" alt="Screenshot_02" title="Screenshot_02">
<img width="125" height="250" src="./img/new3.jpg" alt="Screenshot_03" title="Screenshot_03">
<img width="125" height="250" src="./img/new4.jpg" alt="Screenshot_04" title="Screenshot_04">
</div>

## Setup

First of all, include the dependency in your app build.gradle.kts:

1. Put this code in settings.gradle.kts (root kotlin dsl) in ```repositories``` block
```kotlin.kts
  dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
      // example
      maven {
        url = uri("https://jitpack.io")
      }
    }
  }
```
If using groovy dsl
```groovy
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
```

2. Put dependencies into build.gradle.kts (app/build.gradle.kts kotlin dsl)
inside the ```dependencies``` block

```gradle.kts
implementation("com.github.hasanelfalakiy:foldable-cardview:${version}")
```

Or get the aar in the [Releases](https://github.com/hasanelfalakiy/FoldableCardView/releases/latest) section.

## Declaring the view

After you have the Library correctly setup, just declare the FoldableCardView in your xml:

```xml
<com.andihasan7.foldablecardview.FoldableCardView
    android:id="@+id/profile"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:title="Passengers"
    app:icon="@drawable/ic_person"
    app:inner_view="@layout/mycustomview"
    app:expandOnClick="true"
    app:animationDuration="300"
    app:startExpanded="false"/>
```
The only required attributes are `inner_view` and `title`. The other attributes are optional.

You can specify a custom title and icon on the header on the card by setting the attribute ```app:title``` and  ```app:icon``` respectively.

After you created the base xml, just create your custom layout and place it inside your ```layout``` folder.

Now just pass your newly created layout resource to the ```app:inner_view``` attribute. By setting the attribute ```app:expandOnClick="true"``` the card will have a default behaviour (expand/collapse on click); By setting the `animationDuration` attribute you can set a custom animation time, and by setting the `startExpanded` attribute the card will be automatically expanded when inflated.

Done! Now your FoldableCardView is ready to roll.

## Usage

If you want some basic Foldable Card without any custom behaviour, setting the view in the XML is enough. Otherwise just declare your FoldableCardView in your Activity/Fragment and you're ready to use its methods.

### Java
```java
FoldableCardView card = binding.profile;

 //Do stuff here
```
### Kotlin

```kotlin
val card : FoldableCardView = binding.profile

 //Do stuff here
```

You can use ```expand()``` and ```collapse()``` to respectively expand and collapse the card, and use ```isExpanded()``` to check if the card is expanded or not.
You can change the title and icon of the card dynamically by using ```setTitle()``` and ```setIcon()``` methods.

You can also set an OnExpandedListener to the card:

### Java
```java
card.setOnExpandedListener(new OnExpandedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onExpandChanged(View v, boolean isExpanded) {
        Toast.makeText(applicationContext, isExpanded ? "Expanded!" : "Collapsed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
});
```
### Kotlin

```kotlin
card.setOnExpandedListener { view, isExpanded ->
    Toast.makeText(applicationContext, if(isExpanded) "Expanded!" else "Collapsed!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
 }
```
